My process for my blockout began with wanted to create the first thing the player will see which is the gates of Heaven. From then on it was mapping everything out in order of when the character will see it 
aka the courtyard, training grounds, hallway, chapel, bathroom, and then leading up back outside to the tower where they face their final trial. 
Difficulties I have had was most objects not appearing on my map so I would have to go back and adjust them or rebuild the structure entirey which explains why most things are missing at this moment,
but I am continuing to build and create this into a fully finished map and adding more structures towards it to deifne the ares such as the chapel and the statue as well as the tower and the five floors within it.  


Attached I have the video of my blockout and a quick tour around it.
