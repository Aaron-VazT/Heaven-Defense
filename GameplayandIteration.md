My process of finshing the tower for the player as well as adding ym enemies. 
I did have to cut back on doors due to function errors which I will solve soon, but other than that I am proud of the design choices I made such as the arena and the tower design layout, having the player fight in waves.
Even though I do like the layout of the tower, I do need to add more space for the player to move freely as well as the need to adjust the enemies they encounter, making sure it isn't too difficult.

**UPDATE POST PLAYTEST**

After having volunteers playtest the level, I have improved on where to have certain objects as well as changing where certain enemies where facing, especially in the beginning 
Having enemies face away to give the player time toreact before they can get closer to attack.

There were issues of enemies ebcoming too much and area too small as showed here

So Ia dded more space for the player to attack and enemies that would pose less of a challenge.
