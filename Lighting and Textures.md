I used a few custom made wads created by other level designers for Quake and I have credited them in my credits page here --> https://github.com/Aaron-VazT/Heaven-Defense/blob/main/Credits.md
I waited until after added mytextures to add lighting because it would allow me to see what textures worked ebst and how the lighting worked better than it would have had I used the greybox wads

For these areas I wanted to give the destroyed feeling of coming home to find it in ruins and swarming wiht enemies. So I added dramatic effects where I could, mostly relying on flames as the primary lighting source.

At the bottom you'll see how everything looks in the editor and where I placed my lighting boxes and such.
