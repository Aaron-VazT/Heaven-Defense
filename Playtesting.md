I have had some volunteer to playtets my level at it prototype form in order to find any errors in gameplay, environment. and overall design of the level.
Using a feedback form I was able to see where I wa slacking and what I could do to prove the level design. 



# Playtest 1

1. Lacking in enemies
2. open space
3. needing hills or natural walls to enhance the environment
4. lacking in pickups
5. more trigger functions

   Overall, based on my current feedback, I would need to prioritize my environment including its walls and any objects and architecture to add more ambience to it.
   My second priority is the overall enemy placement as well as pickups and to basically finish the overall level and its functions.
