My process of finshing the tower for the player as well as adding ym enemies. 
I did have to cut back on doors due to function errors which I will solve soon, but other than that I am proud of the design choices I made such as the arena and the tower design layout, having the player fight in waves.
Even though I do like the layout of the tower, I do need to add more space for the player to move freely as well as the need to adjust the enemies they encounter, making sure it isn't too difficult.
